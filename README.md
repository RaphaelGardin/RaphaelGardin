### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Raphael Gardin
#### I am a Computer Science student at Instituto MauÃ¡ de Tecnologia 
 I work as an Assistant Software Engineer at PicPay. I'm proficient in back-end development, particularly with Java, Kotlin, and Android, where I've been using tools like View Binding to enhance mobile applications. While I enjoy the challenges of back-end systems, I also have a passion for UI/UX, ensuring that the solutions I help build are both functional and intuitive. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to apply my skills in real-world projects, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn and improve.

Previously, I won a TEDed championship, which helped me develop strong communication and problem-solving skills. Looking forward, I aim to further refine my technical skills and explore leadership opportunities in software engineering.



Skills: JAVA / PYTHON / C / C++ / MONGODB / SQL / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
